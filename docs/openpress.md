# OpenPress Exporter: Comprehensive WordPress Backup Plan

## Overview

The OpenPress Exporter aims to create a comprehensive backup of WordPress data in JSON format. This document outlines the plan for backing up not just posts, but also comments and other crucial elements of a WordPress site.

## Data to be Exported

1. Posts and Pages
   - ID, title, content, slug, status, creation date, modification date, publication date
   - Author information
   - Featured image and its metadata
   - Custom fields (post meta)

2. Comments
   - ID, post ID, author name, author email, author URL, content, approval status, parent comment ID
   - Comment meta data

3. Users
   - ID, username, email, display name, registration date, roles
   - User meta data (excluding sensitive information)

4. Categories and Tags
   - ID, name, slug, description, parent (for categories)
   - Relationships with posts

5. Custom Taxonomies
   - Similar structure to categories and tags

6. Media Library
   - ID, file path, alt text, caption, description
   - Metadata (dimensions, file type, etc.)

7. Navigation Menus
   - Menu structure, menu items, custom links

8. Site Settings
   - General settings from wp_options table (excluding sensitive data)

## JSON Structure

The exported data will be structured as follows:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "exported_on": "ISO8601 DateTime",
    "wp_version": "WordPress Version",
    "openpress_exporter_version": "Exporter Version"
  },
  "data": {
    "posts": [...],
    "pages": [...],
    "comments": [...],
    "users": [...],
    "categories": [...],
    "tags": [...],
    "custom_taxonomies": [...],
    "media": [...],
    "menus": [...],
    "settings": {...}
  }
}
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a new `OpenPressExporter` class
2. Implement methods for each data type (posts, comments, users, etc.)
3. Use WordPress functions and direct database queries where necessary
4. Implement data sanitization and privacy protection measures
5. Create a method to assemble all data into the final JSON structure
6. Implement chunked processing for large datasets to avoid timeout issues
7. Add options for users to select which data types to include in the export

## Future Considerations

- Option to export data in SQL format for direct database restoration
- Incremental backup feature for large sites
- Integration with cloud storage services for backup storage
- Import functionality for the OpenPress CMS

## Security and Privacy

- Exclude sensitive data such as password hashes and private keys
- Provide clear warnings about the comprehensive nature of the export
- Implement proper user capability checks before allowing export

## Testing

- Develop a suite of unit tests for each export function
- Perform full export tests on various WordPress configurations
- Validate exported JSON for structure and completeness

This plan provides a foundation for creating a comprehensive WordPress data exporter for OpenPress. As development progresses, we can expand on these areas and add more detailed specifications for each component.
